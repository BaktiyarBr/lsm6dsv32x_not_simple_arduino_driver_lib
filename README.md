# **LSM6DSV32X Arduino Driver**

## **Overview**
This repository provides an Arduino driver for the **LSM6DSV32X** sensor from STMicroelectronics. The LSM6DSV32X is a high-performance 6-axis IMU featuring a 3D accelerometer and 3D gyroscope.

This driver supports both **I2C** and **SPI** communication protocols and allows seamless integration into Arduino projects for measuring acceleration, angular rate, and related motion features.

to use just clone the repo and you can change example.ino according to this 
https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STMems_Standard_C_drivers/tree/master/lsm6dsv32x_STdC/examples

## **API Documentation**

### **Platform-Specific Functions**
- `IO_Read()` - Reads data from the LSM6DSV32X sensor over I2C/SPI.
- `IO_Write()` - Writes data to the sensor over I2C/SPI.
- `platform_delay()` - Delays execution for a specified time in milliseconds.

### **Conversion Utilities**
- `npy_half_to_float()` - Converts half-precision floats to single-precision floats.
- `sflp2q()` - Converts 3D scaled floating-point vectors into quaternions.
